**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I went to Bagmane Tech park to attend an event in Google's office. But since it is a private place, 

1. It doesn't allow any visitors from any gate other than the main gate (where we have to get our Visitor's pass)  
 
2. It doesn't even allow an exit of visitors (Visitors = people who don't have ID of working there) from any other gates as I experienced that day, and we have to use the Main gate compulsorily for that as well. 

So when we booked a ride from Namma Yatri, it routed us through the shortest way (from the back gate), which the security denied. So the driver had to go around and drop us at the main gate (which was extra 3km) 

The driver demanded unrealistic extra fare (like 150 ruppees only for 4km) but the Namma Yatri app showed only like 70 (because it was using the shortest route from the back gate to calculate the fare).

**Describe the solution you'd like**
This situation is problematic for both the driver as well as the customer. 
This problem can be solved by keeping a list of frequently traveled private places and having an option in the app to ask the customer whether he's going there as an employee or a visitor. 

If it's a visitor, the app will always show the route from the main gate. And we can also add an option for users to "inform" whether a place has an restricted gate access for visitors like this. It's important to remember the choice and always use the default option as necessary with an option to change it in the future as well;

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
An alternative solution can be to always use main gate for visitors and we can keep track of the history of users who frequently book rides from within Bagmane Tech park which can confirm the fact if they're employees or not;

I'd like this issue to be assigned to myself if possible, so I can work on this pull request if possible ;
