Namma Yatri is a Direct-to-Driver open mobility platform, developed by Juspay, powering the next-generation of mobility applications in India.

The code in this repository are divided into sub-projects - Backend and Frontend.

## Contributing

We strongly believe in the power of open-source. The main purpose of this repository is that the development of the mobility stack happens at an open-to-all platform, where anyone can inspect and contribute. The repository should evolve, adding more features and make existing features faster, correct and easy to use.
We welcome contributions to the repository in the form of bug-reports, code patches, documentation updates and feature requests or heads-up for breaking changes in any of the dependencies.

We welcome contributions from the community. Please read through our
[contributing guidelines](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).
